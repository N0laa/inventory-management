# Inventory Management in C

This is a simple command line program for managing inventory, written in C. I used this project to learn the fundamental C concepts such as manual memory management, structs, and modular programming.

## Compile and execute

```bash
gcc main.c inventory.c -o main
```

## To execute this program use:

```bash
./main
```

# Commands

Add a new item to the inventory:

```bash
add <name> <quantity> <price>
```

List all items in the inventory:

```bash
list
```

Exit the program:

```
exit
```

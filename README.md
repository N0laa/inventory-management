# Inventory Management in C

This is a simple command line program for managing inventory, written in C. I used this project to learn the fundamental C concepts such as manual memory management, structs, and modular programming.

## Compile and execute

To compile the program run:

```bash
gcc main.c inventory.c -o main
```

To execute the program use:

```bash
./main
```

# Commands

- `add <name> <quantity> <price>`: Adds a new item to the inventory.

- `list`: Lists all items in the inventory.

- `exit`: Exits the program.
